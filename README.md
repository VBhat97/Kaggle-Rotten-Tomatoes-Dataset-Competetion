Sentiment analysis is one of the applications of
natural language processing, which aims at using technologies
such as artificial neural networks to analyze emotions. This
project intends to find the best model for predicting the correct
sentiment in the Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset in Keras
using Convolutional Neural Networks. The Rotten Tomatoes
movie review corpus is a collection of movie reviews collected by
Pang and Lee. The dataset mainly contains the Phrase column as
the input after preprocessing using Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques and the Sentiment column as the output with
5 possible outputs ranging from 1 to 5. For our purpose, we
use convolutional neural network (CNN) along with some fully
connected layers at the end. The accuracy, recall, precision and
figure of merit (f-1) score are the metrics used to measure the
efficiency of the model.
